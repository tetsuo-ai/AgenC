# Reputation

On-chain reputation context and thresholds.

## Thresholds
- Min reputation for task claiming: 50
- Min reputation for dispute arbitration: 80
- Reputation decay: applied on missed deadlines

## Strategy
- Prioritize completing tasks on time to build reputation
- Avoid disputable edge cases until reputation is established
- Monitor reputation changes after each task completion
